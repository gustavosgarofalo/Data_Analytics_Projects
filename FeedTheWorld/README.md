Primary problem:
Given that the world population is increasing rapidily, what is the level of food production we will have to grow in order to sustain ourselves in the future years?

Secondary problems:
What amount of agricultural production crops will be destined as feed and what amount for food? Who eats the food we produce? 
Provide two countries that represent a completely different scenario. Depict countries with different demographics to see how they distribute their agricultural yeld.

Explanation:
Being able to observe and define how different kind of food destination and production behaves trough time. The "Food" mentioned along the project, represents the crops that are directly fed to humans, and in the other hand "Feed", is all the food cultivated in order to feed animals (such as cattle, chicken.) that will later feed the humans. What are the trends? Which variables impacts and which are more impacted by the advance of both scenarios.

The project is intended to raise awareness on agricultural efficiency. As population grow, government and private sector have to be aware on how to improve efficiency in production, as well as citizens have to be more responsible as consumers.

  This is an individual project, that really captivates my interest. This project is based on premises that althought are reliable in a quantitative point of view, lacks consideration for several other possible variables and prediction methods. It has partial conclusions presented on the document "Presentatin.ppt", that led to more questions being raised and more interest on my behalf. 
  The intention for the future is to gather more variables to help me explain with more accuracy, what determines the levels of food production other than population growth, and measure the impacts of two different kind of crops enviromental impacts (Feed and Food). Other future intentions are to test other prediction models to determine the trends and produce a top notch web visualization of the results.
