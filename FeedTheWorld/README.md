Primary problem:
ยง	Scope: Given that the world population is increasing, what is the level of food production we will have to grow ins order to sustain ourselves in the future years?

Secondary problems:
ยง	What amount of agricultural production crops will be destined as feed and what amount for food? Who eats the food we produce? 
ยง	Provide two countries that represent a completely different scenario. Depict countries with different demographics to see how they distribute their agricultural yeld.

The project is intended to raise awareness on agricultural efficiency. As population grow, government has to be aware on how to improve efficiency in production, as well as citizens have to be more responsible as consumers.
